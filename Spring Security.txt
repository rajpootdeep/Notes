Spring Security defines a framework for security.

Implemented using servlet filters in the background

Two methods of securing an app : declarative and programmatic

Declarative - define app security constraints in configuration class, 

Programatic - Spring Security provides an API for custom application coding.

Spring provide a bulk of security functionality with servlet filters


--> If Spring Security is on the classpath, Spring Boot automatically secures all HTTP endpoints with “basic” authentication. However, you can further customize the security settings, Spring Security provides a filter that intercepts that request and authenticates the user.
