2. Externa/Linux commands : each external command is a separate executable program written in programming language i.e. C


#Linux directory command
$ pwd  //print pren=sent working directory
$ pwd -L //show present dir with logical path
$ pwd -P //how with physical path

$ ls //list all folders
$ ls -a //list all files including hidden files
$ ls -l //list in long list format
$ ls -lh //display file sizes
$ ls -lhS //displays files sizes in descending order
$ ls -r //print the lsit in reverse order
$ ls ~ // gives content of home directory
$ ls ../ //gives contents of parent directory


 cd //  changing directory
$ cd // it will back to home directory  from any directory we are working
$ cd ~
$ cd $Home //same as $ cd
$ cd - // take to previuos directory
$  cd .. //parent direcotry
$ cd/ //change to root direcotry
$ cd ~username // change to another users home direcotry
$ cd 'directory name with space' // to specified dir
$ cd Dir\name\with\space //same as above one




 mkdir // create new directory
 rmdir // remove directory
rm //removes a file

$ rmdir -p //delete directory it's sub directory

$ mv oldfile newname //rename the file // moves the file
$ rename <expression> <directory> // rename files same as mv
$  rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/'* //rename all directory from upper case to lowercase
